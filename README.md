# Testing System - EasyAKS
**EasyAKS: Android Quiz App for Exam Preparation**

EasyAKS is an Android application designed to help users prepare for exams by testing their knowledge through a quiz format. Similar to the popular game show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” EasyAKS presents users with questions and multiple-choice answers. The goal is to select the correct answer and progress through the quiz.
